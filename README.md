## Description

We built [Day In The Park](https://jmulcahy92.github.io/Day-in-the-Park/) because we wanted to create a one-stop app for avid hikers & amateur explorers alike, letting everyone plan their day adventures in one, or all, of our nation's national parks. 

While there are apps that provide information about national parks, we wanted to create a place where the user could get all relevant info about the park, its weather, and available activities all in one place, without having to conduct a scavanger hunt through numerous links. Our website allows the user to plan their [Day In The Park](https://jmulcahy92.github.io/Day-in-the-Park/) from one location. 

Our application combines activities for each park along with all relevant information, such as hours, fees, contact info, directions, and weather in one convenient place. The application also saves user's activity choices for all parks, returning pertinent info for any park the user chooses. We provide links to each national park as well, in case the user wants to dive deeper into planning their outing. 

Throughout the process, we honed in on what data we thought was truly relevant to our users. It took a few tries to make sure that the data displayed was helpful and that the user was not overloaded with information when looking at our website. We hope that ensuring easy navigation and concise display of information will make our users more likely to utilize the app. 


[Day In The Park](https://jmulcahy92.github.io/Day-in-the-Park/)'s built-in weather feature and the webpage's ability to remember user input for activities makes browsing the parks and planning a [Day In The Park](https://jmulcahy92.github.io/Day-in-the-Park/) a breeze. The section containing the park's description, its hours, fees, and directions is concise and displays information that users would be most likely to search for. Each section is painlessly digestable and easy to navigate.
